## I. Project Overview

Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are vital for water environment protection, especially in detecting and clearing floating objects. But detecting small ones is challenging due to complex scenes, small sizes, and sunlight reflection. This project presents PSP-YOLOv8s, an improved detection method based on YOLOv8, to enhance accuracy and reliability in detecting small floating objects in complex river environments and contribute to more effective water protection using USVs.
